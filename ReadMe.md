**Insights from the Emergency Room Visit Report Dashboard:**
- Total Patients: A total of 9,216 patients visited the emergency room with 51.05% male and 48.69% female. The majority of patients are old adults (2.3K) and middle-aged (1.7K), followed by elderly (1.6K). Visits are dominated by patients during the weekday, which suggests higher traffic during regular working hours.

- Satisfaction Scores: The average satisfaction score is relatively low at 5.47 out of 10, which may indicate room for improvement in patient satisfaction.
75.10% of patients did not provide a rating, highlighting a need for encouraging more feedback to understand patient experiences better.

- Wait Times: The average wait time is 35.26 minutes, which could be a concern and potentially tied to the low satisfaction scores.

- Year-over-Year Growth: The number of patients increased from 4,338 in 2019 to 4,878 in 2020, showing steady growth in patient visits.

- Department Referrals: A large portion of patients (5,400) are not referred to any specific department, while General Practice sees the highest referrals (1,840).
Other departments like Orthopedics (995) and Physiotherapy (276) handle significant numbers of referrals.

- Satisfaction Scores by Race and Age: Different age groups and races show variation in satisfaction scores, with African Americans aged 31-40 and Native Americans aged 31-40 having lower scores (4.83 and 4.87, respectively), indicating potential concerns in these groups.
White patients aged 21-30 have the highest satisfaction scores (5.68).

**Recommendations:**
- Reduce Wait Times: With an average wait time of over 35 minutes, efforts should be made to streamline processes and reduce delays. 
- Improve Patient Feedback Collection: Since 75% of patients are not providing ratings, Therefore, encorage leaving feedback from patients is crucial for understanding areas that need improvement.
- Target Improvement in Satisfaction: Focus efforts on improving the satisfaction of groups with lower scores, particularly African Americans and Native Americans in the 31-40 age group. 
- Optimize Weekday and Weekend Resource Allocation: Given that most visits occur on weekdays, consider either redistributing appointments or resources to better accommodate weekend demand, or increasing resources on weekdays to effectively handle the higher patient volume.
- Department-Specific Strategies: Address the high volume of patients with no department referral (5,400) by improving triage or patient routing processes.
